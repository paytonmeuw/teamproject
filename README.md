Both merges are fast forward merges because the changes are only being made to neat_branch and messy_branch which bring them ahead of the develop branch before they are merged.
Merge Conflict: A merge conflict would occur if you change the title on both the develop branch and conflict_branch.
NOT a merge conflict: Change title on develop branch and add a comment on conflict_branch.
